# Vancouver House Sales Analysis (2004-2024) - Power BI Dashboard

## Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive data analysis of house sales in Vancouver, from 2004 to 2024. Developed using Power BI, this interactive dashboard aims to uncover key market trends, pricing dynamics, and seasonal patterns within the Vancouver real estate sector.

## Key Features & Analysis

The Power BI dashboard provides interactive visualizations covering:

1.  **Overall Market Trends:**
    * **Number of Buildings Sold:** Tracks the total count of properties sold over the years.
    * **Max, Min, and Average Price:** Provides a summary of the highest, lowest, and average transaction prices, highlighting price fluctuations.
    * **Average Buildings Price by Year:** Visualizes the average property prices year-over-year, clearly showing market growth.

2.  **Sales by Property Type:**
    * Analyzes the distribution of sales across different property categories (e.g., Duplex, Condo, Townhouse, House, Triplex), revealing which types are most prevalent in the market.

3.  **Sales by Season:**
    * Illustrates seasonal variations in sales activity (Fall, Spring, Summer, Winter), identifying peak periods and quieter months for the market.

4.  **Geographic Price Distribution (Average Buildings Price by Neighborhood):**
    * This section aims to visualize the average price of buildings across different neighborhoods, helping to identify high-value areas.

5.  **Square Footage (House) and Price Relationship:**
    * A scatter plot showing the correlation between a house's square footage and its selling price, helping to understand pricing strategies based on size.

## Technologies Used

* **Microsoft EXCEL:** Used for data cleaning (checking for missing data, outliers, standardization, and data types.)
* **Microsoft Power BI Desktop:** Used for analysis and interactive dashboard creation.

## Data Source

The data used for this analysis was [a CSV file containing Vancouver House prices].

## Key Insights & Findings

Based on the analysis, some notable insights include:

* **Significant Market Appreciation:** The average price of buildings in Vancouver has demonstrated substantial growth, escalating from approximately $1M in the early 2000s to over $3.5M by 2024, indicating a robust and appreciating real estate market.
* **Seasonal Peaks:** Sales activity typically peaks during the summer and winter months, with a noticeable decline in spring and fall. This seasonality could be influenced by factors such as school calendars or year-end financial planning.
* **Dominant Property Types:** Duplex, Condos, and Townhouse consistently account for the largest share of sales.
* **Price-Size Correlation:** The scatter plot for Square Footage vs. Price  shows numerous data points scattered across a range of square footage and price. The prominent black horizontal line does not appear to be a regression or trend line indicating a positive correlation. Instead, it looks like it represents the average price for all houses irrespective of square footage.
